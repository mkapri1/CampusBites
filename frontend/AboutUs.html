                    <p align = "center">Campus Bites is your one stop station to finding restaurants around campus. With just one platform discover new places around campus, see what your peers have to say, review the restaurants you go to, use the in-built map and never get lost! We felt that we should build a platform for everybody to make it easier for students, faculty, and staff to find and order food quickly and easily, and also share their experiences. We also know that it can be quite boring eating the same thing each day and so we wanted to bring some more options to the palm of your hand with Campus Bites.Along with this, we also wanted to showcase local businesses and encourage support for these establishments with the implementation of a unique review system that allows for periodic average reviews.</p>
